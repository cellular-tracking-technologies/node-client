## About the Node

The CTT Node is a receiver for LifeTag & PowerTags thats also capable of offloading detections to SensorStations. Nodes can be placed at multiple sites to detect presence or absence of a tag. If deployed in a grid fashion, tag detections can be post processed using rssi-based-trilateration or other statistical methods to localize the tag beep. Detections are automatically uploaded to the CTT cloud when nodes are placed within transmission range of a network-enabled SensorStation. Details and purchasing information on Nodes and SensorStations can be found at the links below:
